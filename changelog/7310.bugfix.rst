Fix ``UnboundLocalError: local variable 'letter' referenced before
assignment`` in ``_pytest.terminal.pytest_report_teststatus()``
when plugins return report objects in an unconventional state.

This was making ``pytest_report_teststatus()`` skip
entering if-block branches that declare the ``letter`` variable.

The fix was to set the initial value of the ``letter`` before
the if-block cascade so that it always has a value.
